# jQuery File Upload for Rails

[jQuery File Upload][1] is a cross-browser javascript library for asynchronus Flash-free file uploading
by Sebastian Tschan (@blueimp). This gem packages it for the asset pipeline in Rails.

You should see the original project page for reference & documentation.
There are no instructions here on how to use the library itself.

## Usage

Add a line to your Gemfile.

    gem 'jquery.fileupload-rails-ui-6'

Now you can require the javascript library in application.js:

    //= require jquery.fileupload

Included (no need to require):

* jQuery Iframe Transport for IE support.
* jQuery UI widget from [jquery-ui-rails][2]

Example Rails application can be found in "demo" directory.

## Upgrading 0.1 to 1.0

You can remove all dependencies of the plugin from you manifest. Before:

    //= require jquery.ui
    //= require jquery.iframe-transport
    //= require jquery.fileupload

After:

    //= require jquery.fileupload

If you downloaded jquery.ui assets into your project, delete them and use [jquery-ui-rails][2] gem instead.
